Published Modules
In addition to modules from the local filesystem, 
Orange can load modules from a public or private registry. 
This makes it possible to publish modules for others to use, 
and to use modules that others have published.

The orange Registry hosts a broad collection 
of publicly available Terraform modules for 
configuring many kinds of common infrastructure. 
These modules are free to use, and orange can
 download them automatically if you specify the 
appropriate source and version in a module call block.

Also, members of your organization might produce
 modules specifically crafted for your own 
infrastructure needs. OrAnge saas and 
Orange Enterprise both include a private module 
registry for sharing modules internally within 
your organization
